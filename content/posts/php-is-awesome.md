PHP is awesome, sometimes
=========================

I quite a job when my employer switched from a Java stack to a PHP
environment. I don't like needles and haystacks. I'm not keen on many
aspects of PHP.

However, a developer and entrepreneur I greatly respect often works with
PHP. He is a true hacker. Within minutes he is able to whip up a script
to perform a small task and show the output on a HTML page. Massaging
some JSON, showing a couple of pictures, interacting with an API. You
name it.

I stand corrected! PHP does have it's uses sometimes.
