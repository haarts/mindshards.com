I\'m looking for a job
======================

It is official; I'm looking for a job in the Utrecht or Amsterdam area.
The position I'm looking for combines cutting edge technology with a
healthy dose of pragmatism and a great team.

After selling my startup company I'm currently very much interested in
Big Data and AI (I even have a degree in the latter!). I can actively
participate in, or initiate, the development of a business or product by
providing realistic technical insight, the necessary programming skills
and the ability to motivate the guys (gals?) implementing the idea.

If you think I can help you, please do email me on
