Predicting house prices
=======================

Our little country is blessed with a monopoly which sort of seems to
work; the online real estate market is dominated by one player called
[Funda](http://funda.nl)

Recently I found myself with a little time on my hands in which I
decided to give an other stab at my Machine Learning aspirations. The
plan is really simple. Scrape said website and try to determine, based
on several features the correct price of a house.

The website holds almost 200,000 houses up for sale which I think are
almost enough to do some proper learning on. I'm going to try several
approached from the Scikit-learn toolkit but I'm certainly also going to
try some Deep Learning approach. Probably there's not enough data but
perhaps some data can be generated.

My scraper can be found here: <https://github.com/haarts/funda_scraper>

More coming soon(ish).
