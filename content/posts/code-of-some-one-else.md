Someone else\'s code
====================

Not too long ago I created a [pull
request](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/978) for Fish. In
that pull request I greatly enhanced Fish's ability to handle Git
repositories. In my humble opinion of course.

In doing so I went all the way. I refactored all the functionality.
Hell, I started all over again! I took the work of many programmers and
threw it out.

All seemed dandy, I had fruitful discussions with other developers and
we worked out a plan which I implemented. But when I finally offered up
the pull request resistance arose from several senior developers in the
community. I was puzzled. I incorporated many of their suggestions but
as it stands my pull request has yet to be merged. I have given up on
that particular request.

Last month I worked hard and long on a piece of open source (Groovy this
time). I, together with a colleague, rewrote the way the application
handled background jobs. The request got merged and promptly got
refactored beyond recognition! All our carefully design decisions and
hard work down the drain. I felt angry!

On the bike home it struck me. The situation eerily resembled the
botched Fish pull request only from the other perspective.

I'll be more observant to the ecosystem next time.
