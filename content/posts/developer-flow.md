Developer flow
==============

An important, and often overlooked, aspect of developing code is setup.

Often I notice that it is not clear how one should proceed. The tasks
are there, the concept is clear but how should you get started on them?

I'm talking about getting into the write code/test loop. Which databases
should be up and running? With what content? Should you use a debugger?
What is the best directory structure for the project?

The last conference I've been to was insightful. Not because of the
talks or the interesting people or the great time I had with colleagues.
But because I saw some very experienced programmers work their magic. I
saw how they wrote tests and code.

Are you procrastinating? Perhaps you haven't established a flow yet. Do
so. And write it down. Others have the same issues.
