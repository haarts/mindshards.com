Developer truths
================

- complexity should be fought every inch of the way

Everything else follows from that; 

- have a damn good reason for your complex solution 
- have a damn good reason for every line of code 
- the only good code is delete code 
- the best code is never written code 
- ORYO: only repeat yourself once 
- upgrade (your dependencies) or die
