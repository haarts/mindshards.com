Four weeks in
-------------

The growth of the plants is somewhat disappointing but all is well. The
system performed without a hitch over the last couple of weeks. I do
rotate the plants on a semi regular basis.

With the next batch I'm going to grow the same kind of plants in soil to
see how the two approaches compare.
