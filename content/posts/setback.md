Setback
=======

All the seeds have germinated!

#### Drought

But the two leftmost seedlings were dried out when I checked this
morning. I gave them some extra water and they seem to recover well. The
water level hardly dropped in 5 days so I think it's a more structural
problem. The level is 15 centimeters below the lid and 10 centimeters
below the bottom of the net pots. The mister is only slightly off center
to the right and also angled slightly to the right.

With the power of [Tie wraps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_tie%5D)
(almost as cool as Duct tape) I fastened the mister to the brick, now
it's far easier to position as you don't have to take into account the
cable pull. I recommend doing that from the start. If this doesn't help
I'll increase the amount of water in the container.

#### Power

While on the subject of setbacks I also noticed the past 5 days that the
battery powering the [Jeenode](http://jeelabs.org) runs out rather
quickly (1 each day, although all 5 were almost depleted). Perhaps a
more sustainable power source is needed.

#### Algae

When upgrading my brick I noticed that some algae started growing on it.
I hope that is not going to be a problem.

#### Warmth

An a related note the temperature in the room is dropping fast,
hampering growth.

#### Light

Last but not least, the seedlings have a strong tendency to grow to the
light. I rotated the pots but this is hardly a solution.
