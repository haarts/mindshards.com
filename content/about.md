I'm an enthusiastic coder and builder in general.

I have a keen interest in crypto-currencies, artificial intelligence and open source software.

## Current

At the moment I'm a co-founder of [21 Analytics](https://21analytics.ch "Crypto asset compliance company"). With it we build compliance software for virtual asset service providers or VASPs for short.
